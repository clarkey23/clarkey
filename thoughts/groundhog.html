        <p class="title">groundhog day</p>
        <p>Groundhog Day is one of my favourite movies. I have probably seen it about a dozen times. If it's available on a flight, I will watch that and Ocean's 11 without consideration. I think Bill Murray does a great job. The different phases that the character goes through are believable and relatable. The punching the guy in the head, the driving on the railway tracks, the killing yourself. The more I watch though, the more I find a problem with his immediate reaction to the loop ending and the failure to recognise the impossibility of a post-loop normal life.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I have heard interviews where the director liked to think that Phil Connors was stuck in the loop for a million days. The common amount thrown around by the armchair(ers) is around 30 years to account for the skill acquisition. Either way, I think the psychological impact in the immediate aftermath would be greater than hinted. The immediate reaction is a euphoric, jumping around, instant plans for the future. Okay, he just woke up after the perfect day with Rita, the love of his life. But her feelings are not close to his! He would have had 99% perfect day with her hundreds, maybe thousands of times at this point. She has known the guy for a couple of days... It's her first week on the job! Okay, he's happy, but he would have thought that even if the loop was over, his love for her could never be returned.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Regarding how he could go on. He has lived at least 30 years in a totally predictable environment where he really did not have any life problems to solve. He did not speak to any of his family or his friends. Everything that happened after the first week was something that he knew was going to happen or did not matter anyway. After getting through the hedonistic and suicidal phases, he just taught himself different skills all day. In the weeks that follow, wouldn't not knowing the future cause debilitating anxiety? He would be returning to a life that he does not know with people that no longer recognise him.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I imagine Brooks Hatlen when he woke up not knowing where he was. This would be on a totally different level. Every time he heard _I Got You Babe_, it would be extremely triggering, PTSD levels I would expect. If Phil saw any of those people again, especially Larry, it would bring horrible memories. When I was in Year 9, so around 15 years old, my mother went away for a week, and I had to get myself to the train station in the morning. I used Let Her Go by Passenger as my alarm (I had never really had an alarm before this). To this day (a 25-year-old man), I still get flashbacks and have a negative association to that song when hearing it. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Then he wants to live in the same town going forward. That's problematic (horrible word, pls continue)?  He knows everyone and no one really knows him. That would be awkward. How could he speak to people without sounding like a full-on stalker?</p>
        <br>
        <p>In summary, it's a great film, but the happy ending does not make sense to me. He would be a totally broken man by the end of it. He could not go on to live a normal life. Debilitating anxiety. Fear of the unpredictability of life. Or maybe he goes to work on Monday and marries Rita and has lots of children in Punxsutawney.</p>
